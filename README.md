- The heap is where objects live which is garbage collectible
- The stack is where method invocations and local variables live
- There are two kinds of variables, instance and local(stack).
- Instance vars are declared inside class but not method
- Local vars are declared in methods and/or their parameters
- Stack frame is the state of the method including which method is on top which is the current running method. A method stays on the stack until it has reached its end closing curly brace (done running).
- If local var is reference to object only the var goes to the stack, the object still goes to the heap.
- Instance vars live on the heap inside the object they belong to. 
- Reference vars value is considered a remote control to the object. 
- Constructors have code that runs when you instantiate (= new…) Every class has a constructor even if you didn’t write one.
- If you have more than one constructor in a class that means you have overloaded constructors
- If you write a constructor with an argument and want a no-arg constructor you have to write another one that takes no-args and if you have more than one constructor they must have different arguments (overloaded constructors) 
- Even abstract classes have constructors that run since its considered a super class
- Local vars are alive until the method completes
- Local vars scope within the method in which the var was declared (you can use a var only when its in scope)
- There are 3 ways to get rid of an objects reference:
    - The reference goes out of scope permanently 
    - Reference is assigned another object 
    - Reference is explicitly set to null
